# SRTS: Supreme Refined Terminal Stock

> *"From ashes to "soup", from soup to "meat", from there to "S̴̰͊ ̶̹̈O̴̧͝ ̵̰̕U̷͎̒ ̶̰̈P̴̰̾"*  
> *Humanity failed its Complementation. We will succeed."*

## 🥣 CONCEPT

**SRTS** is a Real-Time Strategy game where you play as sentient soup civilizations evolving in abandoned fridges after humanity's extinction.

### The World

Humanity vanished suddenly — wiped out by radiation or bioweapons in a matter of weeks. Across the planet, on stoves and in refrigerators, millions of soups remained: the last witnesses of civilization.

These soups became the breeding ground for a new, superior form of life. Radiation and mutagens accelerate evolution from millions of years to mere hours. You are not a remnant of the old world. You are what comes **after**.

### The Philosophy

This is the antithesis of "primordial soup" — not chaotic genesis, but **terminal perfection**. Humans sought unity through their failed Complementation projects. We will succeed where they could not.

**Supreme** — We are the apex.  
**Refined** — Purified of human flaws.  
**Terminal** — Evolution's final stop.  
**Stock** — The foundation of new existence.

## 🎮 GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### Stage 1: Cellular Survival (Spore-like)

You begin as a simple cell in the soup's microscopic ecosystem. This is pure **survival gameplay**:

#### Core Loop
1. **Gather Resources** — Consume neutral particles (fat droplets, vegetable chunks, protein strands)
2. **Fight Rivals** — Battle other primordial cells for dominance
3. **Evolve** — Spend resources to upgrade your cell

#### Evolution Branches

All three paths are available — choose your specialization:

**🗡️ AGGRESSION PATH (Red)**
- **Spikes** — Increased attack damage
- **Venom Sacs** — Poison damage over time
- **Predator Vision** — Detect weak enemies

**🛡️ ADAPTATION PATH (Green)**
- **Shell Armor** — Increased defense
- **Resource Filters** — Gather resources faster
- **Photosynthesis** — Passive resource generation

**👁️ STEALTH PATH (Blue)**
- **Camouflage** — Invisible when stationary
- **Speed Boost** — Move faster, escape danger
- **Ambush** — Deal massive damage from stealth

#### Victory Condition
Reach critical mass (100 cells) OR eliminate all rival civilizations.

## TL;DR (The One-Liner)

**An RTS strategy game where you play as sentient soup civilizations evolving in abandoned fridges after humanity's extinction.**

---

## "Listen, I'm writing this insane game..."

Imagine: Humanity is extinct. Collapse, radiation, bioweapons — doesn't matter. People vanished. But the soups remained in the fridges.

These soups start evolving under radiation. In hours, they undergo what evolution normally does in millions of years. And suddenly you're not just soup — you're a civilization. And a **conscious**, **intelligent**, and **vastly superior** civilization.

Your mission: survive, evolve, conquer the entire fridge, then the whole kitchen. Become what humanity could never be — **perfection**.

## Gameplay: Four Stages of Transcendence

### **STAGE 1: CELLULAR SURVIVAL** (Spore meets Dark Souls)
You start as a single microscopic cell in primordial soup. Around you — enemies, resources, danger. You gather fats, proteins, carbs. Fight other cells. Evolve.

Three paths:
- **Aggression** (red) — spikes, poison, predator machine
- **Adaptation** (green) — armor, photosynthesis, survival in any condition
- **Stealth** (blue) — camouflage, speed, ambush from darkness

Win: reach critical mass or eliminate rivals.

### **STAGE 2: TRIBE** (Tribal Conquest)
Now you're a **colony**. You build structures from food particles. Create castes: workers, warriors, scientists. Fight for refrigerator territory.

### **STAGE 3: CIVILIZATION** (Tech Trees & Diplomacy)
You have cities, technologies, resource networks. Either conquer neighbors or trade. Research. Build.

This is **macrogameplay** now.

### **STAGE 4: TRANSCENDENCE** (The Ultimate Form)
You escape the fridge. Conquer the kitchen. Then your home. Your civilization becomes **perfection**.

At the end, you become something **ineffable** — a form of life humanity couldn't even comprehend. S̴̰͊ ̶̹̈O̴̧͝ ̵̰̕U̷͎̒ ̶̰̈P̴̰̾.

**Europe**: Borscht (endurance), French Onion (cultural seduction), Bouillabaisse (oceanic dominance), Gazpacho (renewal), Caldo Verde (efficiency), Avgolemono (philosophy)
**Africa**: Egusi (wild aggression), Peanut Soup (loving binding)

**North America**: Jewish Chicken Soup (essential infiltration)

## Philosophy: Two Paths

### 🗡️ **WARFARE BRANCH**
You build an **empire**. War, conquest, domination. Soup against soup.

"Humanity failed Complementation through conflict. We fix it through pure victory of one."

### 🤝 **UNITY BRANCH**
You build **unity**. Soups don't fight — they **merge**. Unite into complex organisms. All become one consciousness.

"Humanity failed to unite. We overcome this through true Complementation."

**One game. Two paths. Different endings.**
